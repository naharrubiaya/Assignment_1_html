    <p>Management is an activity consisting of a distinct process which is primarily concerned with the important task of goal achievement. No business enterprise can achieve its objectives until and unless all the members of the enterprise make an integrated and planned effort under the directions of a central coordinating agency. This central coordinating agency is technically known as 'management' and the methodology of getting things done is known as 'management process'.</p>
